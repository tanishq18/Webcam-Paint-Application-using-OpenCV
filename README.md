# Webcam-Paint-Application-using-Video-Tracking-and-Finding-Contour-of-Interest

This Python application uses OpenCV library to track any blue object in the frame and uses the detected object to draw colored lines (Blue, Green, Red and Yellow).<br>
To perform video tracking an algorithm analyzes sequential video frames and outputs the movement of targets between the frames.<br>
There are a variety of algorithms, each having strengths and weaknesses. Considering the intended use is important when choosing which algorithm to use.<br> 
There are two major components of a visual tracking system: target representation and localization, as well as filtering and data association.<br>
Video tracking is the process of locating a moving object (or multiple objects) over time using a camera.<br>
